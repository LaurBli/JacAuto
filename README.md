# JacAuto
This is an app I am creating for my colleagues.
Each car from our work have a road paper that need to be completed after every trip. 
The paper has different categories where it is required to divide the total number of kilometres, according to the activities we performed during that trip.
It is a pretty streamlined and easy app, but being my first real solo project, I am proud of it.
